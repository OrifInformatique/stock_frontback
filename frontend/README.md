# react-project-template

This is a starting template for a React projet using Tailwind, built with Webpack.

# Use the template

1. Clone the project.
2. Execute `npm install`.
3. Copy-paste the `.env-template` file and rename it `.env`.
4. Edit the `APP_ROOT` variable with the path to the project root. You can also edit the port if needed.

_For example, if your project is located in `/my-projects/react`, `APP_ROOT` will be :_

```env
APP_ROOT=/my-projects/react
```

5. Execute `npm run serve`.
6. This page will open in your browser : [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

_Here, `4000` is the port specified in the `.env` file. If you changed it, also change it in the URL._

# You're done !

You can start coding in the `/src` folder !
